Text messaging has revolutionized communication in the modern world, but it comes with its own challenges, such as unwanted promotional messages that clutter our inboxes. The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning-based SMS spam detection system that can identify and filter out spam messages from legitimate ones. By achieving this, we aim to enhance the communication experience for mobile users and reduce the annoyance caused by unsolicited SMS messages.

## Problem Aimed to Solve

Unwanted SMS spam messages can be annoying and potentially harmful. The primary problem this project aims to solve is to automatically identify and classify SMS messages as spam or not, allowing users to filter out unwanted messages and prioritize important ones. The key objectives are as follows:

- Build a robust SMS spam detection model using NLP and Machine Learning.
- Provide users with a tool to automatically filter out spam messages from their inbox.
- Enhance user experience and security in SMS communication.

## Data Description

The project relies on a dataset consisting of labeled SMS messages. Each message is labeled as "spam" or "ham." The dataset contains the following information:

- **Text Content**: The actual text of the SMS messages.
- **Label**: A binary label indicating whether the message is spam (1) or ham (0).

The dataset is representative of real-world SMS messages and is divided into a training set for model training and a testing set for evaluation.


## Challenges and Learning

During the development of this SMS spam detection project, several challenges were encountered, leading to valuable learning experiences:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preprocessing text data, including tokenization, stop-word removal, and feature extraction.
- **Model Selection**: Choosing the most suitable Machine Learning algorithms![image](https://github.com/SnigdhaVrma/SMS-Spam-Detection-Project/assets/133538251/fc702b00-80c3-4dac-9929-d4a09072398c)
 and NLP techniques for the task.
- **Imbalanced Data**: Handling class imbalance issues when dealing with a disproportionate number of spam and ham messages.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Selecting appropriate evaluation metrics to assess model performance, considering false positives and false negatives.
- **Deployment**: Preparing the model for deployment, including integration into a user-friendly interface.

  This project has provided insights into the practical application of NLP and Machine Learning for text classification tasks and has highlighted the importance of data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation. We hope that this project serves as a valuable reference for those interested in SMS spam detection and NLP applications.



## Project Overview

This GitHub repository contains the code and dataset used for training and evaluating the SMS spam detection model. The dataset consists of 5,574 SMS messages tagged as either "ham" (legitimate) or "spam." To build an effective spam detection system, we have performed the following tasks:

1. **Data Collection**: We collected a diverse set of SMS messages to train and test the model.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: We cleaned and prepared the dataset, including the removal of stop words to improve model accuracy.

3. **Feature Engineering**: We extracted relevant features from the text messages to feed into our machine learning model.

4. **Model Development**: We developed and trained a machine learning model using natural language processing techniques to classify messages as either ham or spam.

5. **Evaluation**: We evaluated the model's performance using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
