# SMS-Spam-Detection-Project


Text messaging has revolutionized communication in the modern world, but it comes with its own challenges, such as unwanted promotional messages that clutter our inboxes. The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning-based SMS spam detection system that can identify and filter out spam messages from legitimate ones. By achieving this, we aim to enhance the communication experience for mobile users and reduce the annoyance caused by unsolicited SMS messages.

## Project Overview

This GitHub repository contains the code and dataset used for training and evaluating the SMS spam detection model. The dataset consists of 5,574 SMS messages tagged as either "ham" (legitimate) or "spam." To build an effective spam detection system, we have performed the following tasks:

1. **Data Collection**: We collected a diverse set of SMS messages to train and test the model.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: We cleaned and prepared the dataset, including the removal of stop words to improve model accuracy.

3. **Feature Engineering**: We extracted relevant features from the text messages to feed into our machine learning model.

4. **Model Development**: We developed and trained a machine learning model using natural language processing techniques to classify messages as either ham or spam.

5. **Evaluation**: We evaluated the model's performance using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Getting Started

To use this project or contribute to its development, follow these steps:

1. Set up a Python environment and install the required dependencies as mentioned in the README.

2. Explore the code and dataset to understand the project's structure.

3. Run the code to train and test the SMS spam detection model or make improvements as needed.
